slice()

기존 배열을 건드리지 않고, 지정된 범위의 요소를 복사하여 새로운 배열을 반환합니다.
array.slice(start, end) 형태로 사용합니다.
start 인덱스부터 end 인덱스 전까지의 요소를 복사합니다.


splice()

기존 배열 자체를 수정합니다.
array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...) 형태로 사용합니다.
start 인덱스부터 deleteCount 개수만큼의 요소를 제거합니다.
제거된 위치에 item1, item2, ... 등의 새로운 요소를 추가할 수 있습니다.



따라서 slice(1)은 기존 배열을 건드리지 않고, 인덱스 1부터 배열 끝까지의 요소를 복사하여 새로운 배열을 반환합니다.
반면에 splice(1)은 기존 배열에서 인덱스 1부터 시작하여 요소를 제거하기 시작합니다. 이때 deleteCount를 지정하지 않으면 인덱스 1부터 배열의 끝까지 모든 요소를 제거합니다.
예를 들어, const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];라는 배열이 있다면:

arr.slice(1) 결과는 [2, 3, 4, 5]이 됩니다. 원본 배열은 변경되지 않습니다.
arr.splice(1) 결과는 [2, 3, 4, 5]이 되지만, 원본 배열은 [1]로 변경됩니다. */

        info:`Many Star Wars collectors have long coveted items produced exclusively for fans and audiences in Japan, be it toys, food premiums, apparel items, or posters.  During the original trilogy era of the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, marketing teams around the world were often given broad latitude to create Star Wars poster campaigns to suit local tastes and sensibilities, resulting in a rich variety of advertising imagery. This tradition shifted during the era of the prequels, however, when the same key advertising imagery was utilized across all markets around the globe, with the exception of — interestingly — the US, which did not enjoy the expanded poster campaigns seen in Europe and Asia. There has been a return in recent years to some regionally exclusive poster designs, including in Japan, again giving fans and collectors an opportunity to add a truly unique poster to their collection. As Star Wars Celebration heads back to Japan in 2025, StarWars.com is revisiting some of those rarities.The following 12 Japanese Star Wars movie posters feature designs and/or illustrations used nowhere else in the world, making them especially appealing to fans wishing to collect each unique poster from a specific title (or every title!). You will notice that prequel posters are conspicuously absent from the list, as there were no poster graphics created exclusively for Japan during that era.`},

        info:`The final season of Star Wars: The Bad Batch is here! In Bad Batch Declassified, we’ll explore our favorite moments from each episode, available only on Disney+. Armor up and join us for the ride. Spoiler warning: This article discusses details and plot points from the Star Wars: The Bad Batch episode, “Into the Breach.” If there are two things the Bad Batch are really good at, it’s breaking in — and breaking out. With Omega in the custody of Dr. Hemlock at Mount Tantiss, her Clone Force 99 brothers are concerned only with getting her back. In “Into the Breach,” they come up with a plan to sneak aboard an Imperial station and steal the facility’s coordinates; difficult, to be sure, but the team thankfully has an ex-vice admiral up its collective sleeve. Yet as they devise this covert op, Omega proves to be ever the Batcher herself — already plotting as escape for herself and Hemlock’s other captive children. A great dual-caper tale, here are five highlights.`},
